# Turf Examples

This repository houses simple examples that use [Turf.js](http://turfjs.org/) for solving small, specific GIS and mapping problems. These examples were generated through an assignment for the [New Maps Plus](https://newmapsplus.uky.edu/) course MAP675 *Collaborative Geovisualization*, taught in the Fall of 2017 and the Spring of 2018.

**Purpose:** 

We believe that mapping, data science and visualization, coding, and learning in general happens best in a collaborative environment. Web map development and debugging can be an unfortunately solitary activity. MAP675 is an attempt to redress this through explicit instruction in project management and web map development harnessing the communal potential of open source tools such as Git and the open source libraries that help support the craft of marrying cartography with the latest and greatest of web technologies.

[Turf.js]() is an exciting JavaScript library capable of performing many common geospatial analysis and transformation tasks. The documentation is great, but more examples always help.
