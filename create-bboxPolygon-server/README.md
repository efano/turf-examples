# Dissolve Example

This example takes the public school districts in Hawaii and dissolves them in order to simply get the boundaries of the state.

This example uses the ['turf.dissolve()'](http://turfjs.org/docs#dissolve) method to simplify the school districts dataset into just the state boundaries.
