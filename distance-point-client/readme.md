# Distance Between Random Points Within a GeoJSON File Example

This example builds on [random-great-cirlces-client](https://github.com/newmapsplus/turf-examples/tree/master/random-great-circles-client), but instead of generating random points, points are pulled from a database of airport locations.

Airport Data comes from [Natural Earth Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/airports-2/).

*I just noticed that airports were listed as an idea for a future map in the Random Points & A Great Circle readme file!*
