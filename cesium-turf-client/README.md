# CesiumJS & TurfJS GDP Map Chart

This example takes polygon data, combines it with GDP information, renders it as center points per country, and then plots them through extruded bars in Cesium.

The example uses the Turf [`turf.centerOfMass()`](http://turfjs.org/docs#centerOfMass) method to calculate polygon centers.
